# Code API {#introduction}

The Code API is a [gRPC API](https://grpc.io/) service designed to handle various actions such as creating `Payment Requests`, `Login With Code`, checking intent status, and more. Being language-agnostic, you can use any programming language that supports gRPC to interact with the Code API.

If you require a feature that isn't yet supported by our SDKs, you can directly call the Code API. This approach is particularly useful if you're working with an unsupported language or need to implement something more custom.

::: info Recommendation
When possible, we encourage using our SDKs to interact with the Code API. The SDKs manage the low-level details of constructing the binary blob that represents the payment Intent and signing it with the [rendezvous key](../reference/rendezvous).
:::

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

To begin using the Code API, follow these steps:

1. **Fimilarize yourself with [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)**, the serialization format used by the Code API.
2. **Locate the [Protobuf Definition](https://github.com/code-payments/code-protobuf-api)** for the message you intend to send.
3. **Construct the binary blob** representing the message.
4. **Sign the binary blob** with your [rendezvous key](../reference/rendezvous).
5. **Send the signed binary blob** to the Code API.

The Code API supports a wide range of messages, each with its own Protobuf definition for request and response structures.

## Protobuf {#protobuf}

We use [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (protobuf) to define the structure of messages sent to and received from the Code API.

A protobuf definition is a way to define the structure of a message; simply a text file with a `.proto` extension. This file can be compiled into source code for many different languages. These can then be used to serialize and deserialize messages into a binary format (more compact).

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Person {
  string name = 1; // Field number 1
  int32 age = 2;   // Field number 2
}
```

All the protobuf definitions for the Code API can be found [here](https://github.com/code-payments/code-protobuf-api). Nearly every language has a protobuf library that can be used to construct the binary blob. **You can also construct the binary blob by hand**. 

::: tip
You can play around with the [Protobuf Playground](https://www.protobufpal.com/) to get a feel for how it works.
:::

If you're unsure about the content of a signed message, how to construct it, where to submit it, or how to verify it, please take a look at the [TypeScript](https://github.com/code-payments/code-sdk/blob/main/packages/intents/src/intents/) intents. These are the most up-to-date and accurate representations of the signed messages.

## gRPC {#grpc}

While we use `protobuf` to define the structure of messages, we use `gRPC` to send and receive these messages. The gRPC protocol is a high-performance, open-source, universal RPC framework. It is designed and maintained by Google.

We make use of gRPC tooling that generates client and server code in multiple languages, making it easy to interact with the Code API.

### Web Proxy {#grpc-proxy}

Typically, gRPC requires a direct socket connection to the server. However, this can be difficult to set up in some environments. **Specifically, it can be challenging to use gRPC in a browser environment**.

We provide a custom `HTTP/1.1` gRPC proxy that you can use to interact with the Code API without needing to open a socket connection. This is far easier than opening a socket connection and is the recommended way to interact with the Code API. You can also run the proxy on your own server if you'd like.

Additionally, the proxy is available over HTTP/1.1, which means you can use it in a browser environment.

::: info Recommendation
We recommend using the gRPC proxy to interact with the Code API. It allows you to use simple `fetch(...)` requests to interact with the API instead of opening a socket connection.
:::

## Mainnet Endpoints {#endpoints}

You can use the following URLs to interact with the Code API:

**Proxy URL (HTTP/1.1)**
```raw
https://api.getcode.com/v1
```

Or you can use the direct gRPC URL, which does require a grpc socket connection.

**Direct gRPC URL (HTTP/2)**
```raw
https://api.codeinfra.net
```

## Building Your Own Client {#building-a-client}

When the SDK doesnâ€™t yet support a feature you need, you can build your own client to interact directly with the Code API. In this section, we explain the Code API `envelope protocol` and provide minimal examples using JavaScript, Python, PHP, and Go.

### Request/Response Protocol (HTTP/1.1)

The Code API wraps your inner messages (such as a payment or login Intent) in a simple envelope defined using Protocol Buffers. If you're using our `HTTP/2` endpoint, you can skip this section.

The proto definitions are:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Request {
    string version = 1;
    string service = 2;
    string method = 3;
    bytes body = 4;
}

message Response {
    Result result = 1;
    bytes body = 2;
    string message = 3;

    enum Result {
        OK = 0;
        ERROR = 1;
    }
}
```

#### Request Fields:

- **version**: The API version (e.g. `"1.0"`).
- **service**: The target service (e.g. `"Intents"`).
- **method**: The method to invoke (e.g. `"createIntent"`).
- **body**: The binary-serialized payload of your inner message.

#### Response Fields:

- **result**: The outcome of the request (`OK` or `ERROR`).
- **body**: The binary-encoded response payload.

For example, the following `Request`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "service": "Intents",
  "method": "createIntent", 
  "body": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

Serializes to the following hex string:

```raw
0a03312e301207496e74656e74731a0c637265617465496e74656e74220401020304
```

### Sending a Request 
Below is a minimal JavaScript example that wraps your protobuf-serialized payload in a `Request` envelope and sends it via `HTTP/1.1` POST.

::: code-group

```javascript [js]
import { Request, Response } from '@code-wallet/rpc';

// Assume you already have your payload message 
// (e.g. a payment or login Intent) that has been 
// encoded (and signed) using its protobuf definition.
const payload = myProtoMessage.toBinary();

// Wrap the payload in a Request envelope
const envelope = new Request({
  version: "1.0",
  service: "Intents",     // e.g. "Intents"
  method: "createIntent", // e.g. "createIntent"
  body: payload,
});

// Serialize the envelope to binary
const binaryEnvelope = envelope.toBinary();

// Send the binary envelope using an HTTP POST
fetch("https://api.getcode.com/api/", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream" },
  body: binaryEnvelope,
})
  .then(response => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then(buffer => {
    // Decode the response envelope from binary
    const resEnvelope = Response.fromBinary(new Uint8Array(buffer));
    console.log("Received response:", resEnvelope);
  })
  .catch(err => console.error("Network error:", err));
```

The above examples show how to construct a `Request` envelope and send it to the Code API. The response is also wrapped in a `Response` envelope. You can then extract the binary-encoded payload from the response and decode it using the appropriate protobuf definition.

You can learn more about the payload structure below.

## Intents {#intents}

Code uses the concept of an [Intent](../intents/introduction.md) to represent a user's desired actions. This is different from a blockchain transaction. An Intent is a higher-level abstraction.

The Code Sequencer expects a binary blob that represents the Intent. The binary blob is constructed using the protobuf definition. When you call the `createIntent` API, you'll need to construct the binary blob yourself and sign it with the [rendezvous key](../reference/rendezvous). 

We have several Intent types, such as `RequestToReceiveBill`, `RequestToPayBill`, and `RequestToLogin`. Each Intent type has its own protobuf definition.

At a high level, the Intent structure looks like this:

```proto
message Message {
    MessageId id = 1;
    Signature send_message_request_signature = 3;

    oneof kind {
        RequestToGrabBill     request_to_grab_bill     = 2;
        RequestToReceiveBill  request_to_receive_bill  = 5;
        CodeScanned           code_scanned             = 6;
        ClientRejectedPayment client_rejected_payment  = 7;
        IntentSubmitted       intent_submitted         = 8;
        WebhookCalled         webhook_called           = 9;
        RequestToLogin        request_to_login         = 10;
        ClientRejectedLogin   client_rejected_login    = 12;
        AirdropReceived       airdrop_received         = 4;
    }
}
```

The SDKs are basically wrappers around this protobuf definition. They construct the binary blob for you and sign it with the rendezvous key. If you'd like to use a custom backend or a language that isn't supported yet, it is possible to call our `createIntent` API directly. 

::: info
Take a look at the internals of the SDKs to see how the binary blob is constructed and signed. This will give you a good idea of how to construct the binary blob yourself.

* [TypeScript Example](https://github.com/code-payments/code-sdk/tree/94c5cfa6dc84d380a60b9651b17ddad23b7ad3dc/packages/intents/src/intents)

:::

Below are some examples of how to construct the binary blob for a payment Intent and a login Intent. These examples are based on the protobuf definitions provided earlier. You'll need to sign and wrap these payloads in a `Request` envelope before sending them to the Code API.

### Payment Example {#payment-requests}

A typical server-side integration will look something like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant User
  participant Browser

  User->>Browser: Lands on payment page
  Browser->>Server: Sends order information
  Server->>Code Sequencer: POST /v1/createIntent
  Code Sequencer->>Server: Returns PaymentIntent status
  Server->>Browser: Returns PaymentIntent's client_secret
  Browser->>Code Sequencer: Opens message stream at rendezvous value
```

You can learn more about the payment flow [here](../intents/payment-requests).

In order to call the `createIntent` API manually, you'll need to construct the payment Intent binary blob yourself and sign it with the [rendezvous key](../reference/rendezvous). 

You can do that one of two ways:
* **Use a protobuf library to construct the binary blob**
* Construct the binary blob manually

The protobuf defenition for `RequestToReceiveBill` is as follows (full definition can be found [here](https://github.com/code-payments/code-protobuf-api)):

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message SolanaAccountId {
    bytes value = 1;
}

message Signature {
    bytes value = 1;
}

message MessageId {
    bytes value = 1;
}

message Message {
    MessageId id = 1;
    Signature send_message_request_signature = 3;

    oneof kind {
        RequestToReceiveBill request_to_receive_bill = 5;
    }
}

message RequestToReceiveBill {
    SolanaAccountId requestor_account = 1;

    oneof exchange_data {
        ExchangeData            exact = 2;
        ExchangeDataWithoutRate partial = 3;
    }
}

message ExchangeData {
    string currency = 1;
    double exchange_rate = 2;
    double native_amount = 3;
    uint64 quarks = 4;
}

message ExchangeDataWithoutRate {
    string currency = 1;
    double native_amount = 2;
}
```

#### Constructing the binary blob manually

Given the above protobuf definition, you can construct a payment Intent as follows:

```raw
[
  0x2A, 0x34, 0x0A, 0x22, 0x0A, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x1A, 0x0E, 0x0A, 0x03, 0x75, 0x73, 0x64, 0x11, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x24, 0x40
]
```

#### Decoding the binary blob

Let's decode the given binary serialization based on the protobuf definitions provided earlier.

::: info Recommendation
We don't recommend constructing the binary blob manually unless you have a specific reason to do so. It's error-prone and can lead to unexpected behavior. Use a protobuf library to construct the binary blob.

https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/
:::

#### Message structure
* `0x2A`: This indicates field number 5 (`request_to_receive_bill`) with a wire type of 2 (length-delimited).
* `0x34`: The length of the upcoming `RequestToReceiveBill` message is 52 bytes.

#### RequestToReceiveBill structure
* `0x0A`: This indicates field number 1 (`requestor_account`) with a wire type of 2 (length-delimited).
* `0x22`: The length of the upcoming `SolanaAccountId` message is 34 bytes.

#### SolanaAccountId structure
* `0x0A`: This indicates field number 1 (value) with a wire type of 2 (length-delimited).
* `0x20`: The length of the upcoming value is 32 bytes.
* Following 32 bytes: 0x00 x 32: This is the account ID in bytes format, which in our example, is all zeros.

#### RequestToReceiveBill structure (continued)

* `0x1A`: This indicates field number 3 (partial, which is of type `ExchangeDataWithoutRate`) with a wire type of 2 (length-delimited).
* `0x0E`: The length of the upcoming `ExchangeDataWithoutRate` message is 14 bytes.

#### ExchangeDataWithoutRate structure:

* `0x0A`: This indicates field number 1 (currency) with a wire type of 2 (length-delimited).
* `0x03`: The length of the currency string is 3 bytes.
* Following 3 bytes: `0x75 0x73 0x64`: This is ASCII for the string `"usd"`.
* `0x11`: This indicates field number 2 (native_amount) with a wire type of 1 (64-bit).
* Following 8 bytes: `0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x24 0x40`: This is the number representation of `10.0` for the native amount.

#### Decoded values

From this binary serialization, the values decoded are:
```
request_to_receive_bill:
  requestor_account: 0x00 x 32 (or 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=' in Base64)
  partial:
    currency: "usd"
    native_amount: 10.0
```

This is then signed using the rendezvous key and `POST`ed to the Code Sequencer's `createIntent` endpoint.

You can see an example of this in our [Python SDK](https://github.com/code-payments/code-sdk-python/blob/main/code_wallet/library/message.py).

### Login Example {#login-intents}

The **Login with Code** flow consists of the following steps, you can learn more about the login flow [here](../intents/login).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant User
  participant Browser

  User->>Browser: Lands on login page
  Browser->>Server: Sends login request
  Server->>Code Sequencer: POST /v1/createIntent
  Code Sequencer->>Server: Returns LoginIntent status
  Server->>Browser: Returns LoginIntent's client_secret
  Browser->>Code Sequencer: Open message stream at rendezvous value
```

The login flow is similar to the payment flow, but instead of a payment Intent, you'll be creating a login Intent. The login Intent is a higher-level abstraction that represents a user's Intent to log in to a website or application.

The protobuf definition for [RequestToLogin](https://github.com/code-payments/code-protobuf-api/blob/05e5a67f9e57da8cdeaac122b0256cb997459a69/proto/messaging/v1/messaging_service.proto#L318-L342) is as follows:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Domain {
  string domain = 1;
}

message SolanaAccountId {
  bytes value = 1;
}

message Signature {
  bytes value = 1;
}

message RendezvousKey {
  bytes value = 1;
}

message MessageId {
    bytes value = 1;
}

message Message {
    MessageId id = 1;
    Signature send_message_request_signature = 3;

    oneof kind {
        RequestToLogin request_to_login = 10;
    }
}

message RequestToLogin {
  Domain domain = 1;
  SolanaAccountId verifier = 4;
  Signature signature = 5;
  RendezvousKey rendezvous_key = 6;
}

```

You can construct a login Intent using similar logic as the payment Intent, but
with the [RequestToLogin](https://github.com/code-payments/code-protobuf-api/blob/05e5a67f9e57da8cdeaac122b0256cb997459a69/proto/messaging/v1/messaging_service.proto#L318-L342) protobuf definition. 

::: info
Use the [TypeScript](https://github.com/code-payments/code-sdk/blob/main/packages/intents/src/intents/LoginRequestIntent.ts#L82-L139)
version as a reference for constructing the binary blob.

If there is a feature that you need that isn't supported by the SDKs yet, it is likely that someone else needs it too. We can work together to add the feature to the SDKs.
