# Introduction

The Code payments platform makes accepting small payments on the web simple.
It’s open, permissionless, and requires just a few lines of code—no sign-up
necessary.

After a decade of building consumer platforms and developer tools, we realized
traditional payment systems are too limiting—they offer only large, one-way
payments, involve complex onboarding, and charge high fees. The Code SDK lets
you embed a "Pay with Code" button to charge as little as 5 cents per
transaction, with only a flat 1-penny fee to cover blockchain costs.

## What is Code?

[Code](https://getcode.com) is the mobile wallet app used for payments. It
offers the benefits of self-custodial crypto—global, secure, and simple—without
the hassle of managing private keys, gas fees, or slow transactions. Built on
the [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain and powered by the [Code
Sequencer](../reference/sequencer), Code delivers an instant, global, and
private payments experience.

## What is the Code SDK?

It’s a collection of JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Python, and PHP packages that
let you integrate Code into your website or web app—on both the client and
server sides. 

The SDK provides a simple interface to the Code API.

## What is the Code API?

The Code API is a gRPC-based API that lets you interact with the Code Sequencer.
It’s used to create payment intents, verify payments, and more.
