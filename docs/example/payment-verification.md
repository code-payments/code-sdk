# Payment Verification

We encourage you to verify payments on your server. This ensures that the payment was not tampered with in the browser, and that the payment was actually sent to your wallet. This is especially important if you are selling digital goods or services.

Use the following example to create a payment intent on your server and then show a button for that intent on the browser. You can then forward the user to a success page that includes the intent, which you can verify.

::: info
If you need real-time payment events, see the [Payment Events](./payment-events) example.

## Payment Intent Example

The full example code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/code-payments/code-sdk/tree/main/examples/3-minimal-with-verify).

::: code-group
```js [server.js]
import * as code from "@code-wallet/client";
import express from "express";

const app = express();

// ...

// Create intent (notify the Code Sequencer that you want to receive a payment)
app.post('/create-intent', async (req, res) => {
  const { clientSecret, id } = await code.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: 0.05, // Minimum amount is $0.05 USD
    currency: 'usd',
    destination: 'E8otxw1CVX9bfyddKu3ZB3BVLa4VVF9J7CTPdnUwT9jR',
  });

  console.log('Created intent', id);

  // This value needs to be sent to the browser so that the browser can use it
  // to setup a payment with this intent instance.
  res.send({ clientSecret });
});

// Verify intent (verify that the payment was sent to your wallet)
app.get('/verify/:id', async (req, res) => {
  
  const intent = req.params.id;
  const { status } = await code.paymentIntents.getStatus({ intent });

  // ...
});
```

This snippet creates a payment button that looks like this:
