# Release Branch

This is the release branch for the Code SDK. The latest stable build of the SDK is available in the v1 folder. You can also find the releases on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40code-wallet).

The Code SDK is a set of JavaScript packages that enables any web developer to integrate Code into their website or web app and easily start accepting payments for as little as 5 cents with no sign up required and just a few lines of code.

See the [docs](https://code-wallet.github.io/code-sdk/docs/guide/introduction) for more information.
