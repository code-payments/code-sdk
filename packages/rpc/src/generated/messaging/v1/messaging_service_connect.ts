     * OpenMessageStream opens a stream of messages. Messages are routed using the
     * public key of a rendezvous keypair derived by both the sender and the
     * recipient of the messages. The sender may be a client or server.
     *
     * Messages are expected to be acked once they have been processed by the client.
     * Ack'd messages will no longer be delivered on future OpenMessageStream calls,
     * and are eligible for deletion from the service. Clients should, however, handle
     * duplicate delivery of messages.
     *
     * Only RequestToGrabBill and RequestToReceiveBill are supported for real time events.
     *
     * For grabbing a bill, the expected flow is as follows:
     *   1. The payment sender creates a payment scan code
     *      (see: https://github.com/code-wallet/code-api/blob/master/spec/scan.md).
     *   2. The payment sender calls `OpenMessageStream` on the rendezvous public key, which is
     *      derived by using sha256(scan_payload) as the keypair seed.
     *   3. The payment recipient scans the code and uses `SendMessage` to send their account ID
     *      back to the sender via the rendezvous public key.
     *   4. The payment sender receives the message, submits the intent, and closes the stream.
     *
     * For receiving a bill of requested value, the expected flow is as follows:
     *   1. The payment recipient uses `SendMessage` to send their account ID and payment amount to
     *      the sender via the rendezvous public key, which is derived by using sha256(scan_payload)
     *      as the keypair seed.
     *   2. The payment recipient calls `OpenMessageStream` on the rendezvous public key to listen
     *      for status messages generated by server. It must ignore the original message it sent as
     *      part of step 1.
     *   3. The payment recipient creates a payment scan code
     *      (see: https://github.com/code-wallet/code-api/blob/master/spec/scan.md).
     *   4. The payment sender calls `PollMessages` on the rendezvous public key. This is ok because
     *      we know the message exists per step 1, and doesn't actually incur a long poll. This is a
     *      required hack because we don't have the infrastructure in place to allow multiple listens
     *      on the same stream, and the recipient needs real-time status updates.
     *   5. The payment sender receives the message (any status messages are ignored), and submits the
     *      intent.
     *   6. The payment recipient sees a success/failure/timeout status message and closes the stream.

    /**
     * OpenMessageStreamWithKeepAlive is like OpenMessageStream, but enables a ping/pong
     * keepalive to determine the health of the stream at both the client and server.
     *
     * The keepalive protocol is as follows:
     *   1. Client initiates a stream by sending an OpenMessageStreamRequest.
     *   2. Upon stream initialization, server begins the keepalive protocol.
     *   3. Server sends a ping to the client.
     *   4. Client responds with a pong as fast as possible, making note of
     *      the delay for when to expect the next ping.
     *   5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the stream is explicitly terminated
     *      or is deemed to be unhealthy.
     *
     * Client notes:
     * * Client should be careful to process messages async, so any responses to pings are
     *   not delayed.
     * * Clients should implement a reasonable backoff strategy upon continued timeout failures.
     * * Clients that abuse pong messages may have their streams terminated by server.
     *
     * At any point in the stream, server will respond with messages in real time as
     * they are observed. Messages sent over the stream should not affect the ping/pong
     * protocol timings. Individual protocols for payment flows remain the same, and are
     * documented in OpenMessageStream.
     *
     * Note: This API will enforce OpenMessageStreamRequest.signature is set as part of migration
     *       to this newer protocol
