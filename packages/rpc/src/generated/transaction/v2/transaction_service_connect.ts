     * SubmitIntent is the mechanism for client and server to agree upon a set of
     * transactions to execute on the blockchain.
     *
     * Transactions are never exchanged between client and server. Instead, the
     * required accounts and arguments for instructions known to each actor are
     * exchanged to allow independent and local transaction construction.
     *
     * Client and server are expected to fully validate the intent. Proofs will
     * be provided for any parameter requiring one. Signatures should only be
     * generated after approval of all transactions.
     *
     * This RPC is not a traditional streaming endpoint. It bundles two unary calls
     * to enable DB-level transaction semantics.
     *
     * The high-level happy path flow for the RPC is as follows:
     *   1.  Client initiates a stream and sends SubmitIntentRequest.SubmitActions
     *   2.  Server validates the intent, its actions and metadata
     *   3a. If there are transactions requiring the user's signature, then server
     *       returns SubmitIntentResponse.ServerParameters
     *   3b. Otherwise, server returns SubmitIntentResponse.Success and closes the
     *       stream
     *   4.  For each transaction requiring the user's signature, the client locally
     *       constructs it, performs validation and collects the signature
     *   5.  Client sends SubmitIntentRequest.SubmitSignatures with the signature
     *       list generated from 4
     *   6.  Server validates all signatures are submitted and are the expected values
     *       using locally constructed transactions.
     *   7.  Server returns SubmitIntentResponse.Success and closes the stream
     * In the error case:
     *   * Server will return SubmitIntentResponse.Error and close the stream
     *   * Client will close the stream
